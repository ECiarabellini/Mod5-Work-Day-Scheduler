# Module 5 Work Day Scheduler

## Description
For this project, I was provided starter HTML and CSS code along with multiple action item prompts to make the website dynamic including saving user inputs in local storage and recalling them using Javscript. I utilized jQuery for much of my Javascript tasks as well as dayjs for date/time functionality.

## Usage
User can type text into each hour timeslot and click the blue save button to save. Red color blocks represents the current local hour, gray are past hours, and green are future hours. The day displayed is the current day only.
